Google Docs:

Got rid of the excel doc and created a Trello team for us to track bugs. I added tasks that I think are the basics to complete at a minimum. Feel free to add more! I'm also going to add a google docs folder for us to share files.

I'm going to put a list of features we need at a minimum. We should add whatever feature we think would be cool to have there as well.

When you're working on anything open a branch and name the branch so that we know what you're working on.

Check the open branches before you choose to start on a task, so we don't work on the same thing at the same time.
